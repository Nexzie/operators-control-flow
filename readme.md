2. Question 2

Arithmetic operators

Addition: 1 + 1 = 2; 5+7 = 12

Subtraction: 3-2 = 1; 10-4 = 6

Multiplication: 23 = 6; 74 = 28

Division: 4/2 = 2; 10/5 = 2

Modulus: 9 % 4 = 1; 20 % 4 = 0

Increment: 2++ = 3; 7++ = 8

Decrement: 4--; 5--

Assignment Operators

assign: let high = 9; let low = 7

add and assign: let new +=1; let up +=9

subtract and assign: let prev-=1, let bfr -=5

multiply and assign: let twice _=2; let thrice _=3

divide and assign: let new /= 4; let undo /=1

modulus and assign: let divisive %=4; let first %=2

Comparison Operators

is equal to: 2 == 3 = false; 10 == 10 = true

is identical: 1 === 1 = true; 20 === 2= false

is not equal to: 2 !=3 = true; 4 != 4= false

is not identical: 10 !== 10 = false; 100 !== 1000 = true

greater than: 2 > 7 = false; 4 > 2 = true

greater than and equals to: for(let i = 3; let i >= 100; i++){}; 4 >=3 = true

less than: 9< 200 = true; 10 < 2 = false

less than and equals to: 60 <= 8 = false; 7 <= 7 = true

Logical Operators

logical AND: (2==3 && 10 > 7) = false; (3==3 && 10 > 7) = true;

logical OR: (2==3 || 10 > 7) = true; (2==3 || 10 < 7) = false;

logical NOT: !(2 == 3) true; !(2 < 3) = true;

Bitwise Operators

Bitwise AND: (10==20 & 20==33) = false

Bitwise OR: (10==20 | 20==33) = false

Bitwise XOR: (10==20 ^ 20==33) = false

Bitwise NOT: (~10) = -10

Bitwise left shift: (10<<2) = 40

Bitwise right shift: (10>>2) = 2

Bitwise right shift with zero: (10>>>2) = 2
